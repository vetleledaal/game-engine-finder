# game-engine-finder

Pretty hacky script for easily figuring out the engine used for a game, sets the clipboard for use on [PCGamingWiki](https://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Home).
Requires Python 2+.

## Usage

To use, run the script as `python find-engine.py LocationToExecutable.exe` – should work with both Windows and Linux OSes for identifying supported game engines. Copy to clipboard function seems not to work properly under Linux.
